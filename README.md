# SpendSmart - manage your money

A budget management application that tracks expenses, incomes and savings. The development was carried out in a group of 8 developers under a team leader's management, using the scrum methodology.

## Sign up and Sign in screens

The user registers for the application and enters a profile name, email and password.

## Edit profile screen

You can upload a photo, edit a password, and add additional subscribers to the same account.

## Incomes and expenses screens

A table representing all of our income for the current month.

When adding a record, select a category, description and amount entered/out. We can choose which of the subscribers performed the action and choose the frequency - how many times we want to register the same expense/income.

When adding an expense, if we choose a savings type category, we can choose which saving we want to transfer the money to.

Each record added to the table allows editing and deletion.

The screen includes many features such as filtering by date, sorting by table columns, value search and downloading a CSV file for later use of the data.

In order to optimize the work, the expense and income screen is a generic screen that contains different data.

## Savings screen

Managing savings and tracking their progress. When savings are updated

## Dashboard screen

Displays an analysis of the account status. For a certain month we will see segmentation of income versus expenses, according to different subscriptions and categories.
